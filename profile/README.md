## Hi there 👋
This is the official organization of Spacenoop specific to the UHC plugins, utils and websites.
This organization is ONLY for the UHC related programs. All others applications have another specific organization or are directly on the [Spacenoop default organization](https://github.com/spacenoop)

## Our apps
In this organization you can find the repositories of the following apps:
- The `Spacenoop's official UHC minecraft plugin`
- The `Spacenoop's UHC official modules` (That involves secnarios or gamemodes that are implemented in the UHC minecraft plugin by default and are developped by the same team)
- The `Spacenoop's UHC official module toolkit` (That allows developers approved by the team to create scenarios, gamemodes and additions to our official UHC plugin)
- The `Spacenoop's official MumbleLinkUtil minecraft plugin` (That allows the official spacenoop's UHC plugin to (un)mute, move, deaf and manage users on a mumble server and manage permissions, channels and roles of a mumble server)
- The `Spacenoop's official UHC Discord bot` (That mentions users in a guild or in direct message for UHC games starting soon)
- The `Spacenoop's official UHC REST API` (That allows developers approved by the team to access informations concerning our servers, current games and more...)
- The `Spacenoop's official UHC website`

## Resources
All the documentations for the semi-public repositories such as the UHC API or the UHC module toolkit can be found at [docs.uhc.spacenoop.fr/](https://docs.uhc.spacenoop.fr/).
To request access to a semi-public repository you can either:
* Register yourself as a dev on our [website](https://spacenoop.fr/register). When asked, select the "UHC dev pass" and fill up the form that'll show up. Once done, the team will evaluate your responses and give you (or not) an access to the repositories you need. (The team can contact you during the evaluation process to ensure your identity or the purpose of your application. The team can decline any application if we assume that it can cause security problems or damage to our apps, programms or community)
* Send us a mail with your first name, last name, age, discord username AND id, reason of your application, repositories you request access for and your github profile link.

The team usually responds in 1 to 3 week days (Mon. -> Fri. | 8:00 AM -> 16:00 PM (UTC+2)). If you don't receive a response after that time, do not hesitate to write us an email again or create a ticket on the spacenoop's discord server.
